Back from the future! While working on this release I noticed something is wrong with the dates
in the changelog and in the last two blog posts. They were one month ahead. It's always good to
know that one has more time to do stuff that previously thought.

Anyway, here's another bugfix release. It addresses issues [#115](https://github.com/dkopecek/usbguard/issues/115)
and [#117](https://github.com/dkopecek/usbguard/issues/117).

## Changes

 * refactored USB parser to support multiple handlers per USB descriptor type
 * Qt Applet: device list should be always expanded
 * added support for an audio device related endpoint descriptor

## Thanks

Many thanks to the following people for contributions to this release and to the USBGuard project:

 * [Christian Stadelmann](https://github.com/genodeftest)
