Hello again! Many changes accumulated since the last release so here's another one.

## Major Changes

- Changed the device hashing algorithm to SHA-256 and the representation of the values to base64.
- Possibility to compile the project with libgcrypt instead of libsodium.
- Rewrite of the rule language parser using [PEGTL](https://github.com/ColinH/PEGTL).
- Many Qt applet improvements including the implementation of the device list.
- Added the "parent-hash" attribute to the rule language. You can use this attribute
  to define that a device has to be a child of a specific device.
- Added the "id" attribute to the rule language. This is attribute is a replacement for the standalone
  USB device ID in the rule. The standalone form of USB device id specification is still supported but
  is obsoleted and will be removed in the future.
- Modified the rule language such that all attributes support single and multi valued forms.
- New project logo and icons for the Qt applet!
