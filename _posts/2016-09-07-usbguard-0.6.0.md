Another milestone behind us. The 0.6.0 release brings the promissed CentOS/RHEL 7 compatibility. This means that our
[Copr EPEL-7 repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mildew/usbguard/repo/epel-7/mildew-usbguard-epel-7.repo)
as well as Fedora's EPEL-7 repository will now provide the latest versions of USBGuard. Check it out!

One more very good piece of news is that USBGuard was accepted in Debian and is available in [Sid (unstable)](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=usbguard).
A big thanks goes to Muri Nicanor and others involved in this packaging effort!

## Major Changes

 * Fixed a bug in matching devices against the policy
 * Switched to protobuf based IPC
 * Removed dependency on nlohmann/json package
 * Simplified the IPC and D-Bus interface
 * Extended the usbguard CLI watch subcommand with the ability to wait for the IPC connection to become available.
   See the new `-w` and `-o` options for details.
