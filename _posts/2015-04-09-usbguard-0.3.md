Shortly after the usbguard-0.2 release, we have another one on the table. I didn't plan to release it so early but the Fedora package review process ([rhbz#1209971](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1209971), [rhbz#1209974](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1209974)) forced me to fix or enhance many things. I'd like to thank to *Antti JÃ¤rvinen*, *Petr Lautrbach* and *Ralf Corsepius* for reviewing the submitted packages. Although they didn't yet passed the review, there shouldn't be too many blockers left and the package should be available in Fedora soon.

There are two things I'd like to point out in this release.

 * The packages now include manual pages
 * The USBGuard daemon can now restrict the usage of the IPC interface to a group or to specific users

The manual pages need more love, but it's much better than nothing.

# Major changes

 * Fixed appending of permanent rules
 * Implemented a DAC based IPC access control
 * Ship man pages for usbguard-daemon, usbguard-daemon.conf and usbguard-rules.conf
 * Ship the LICENSE file
 * Fixed distribution RPM spec file. Thanks to Petr Lautrbach and Ralf Corsepius for review.
 * Resolved issues: #18 #19 #13 

# Updating

If you are using the USBGuard Copr repository, run:

    $ sudo yum update usbguard usbguard-applet-qt

Additionally, if the user under which you are running _usbguard-applet-qt_ isn't in the _wheel_ group, you should either add him to that group or change the ACL in _/etc/usbguard/usbguard-daemon.conf_ in order to be able to use the applet.
