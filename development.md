The USBGuard project uses github for tracking issues and the overall development process. If youâ€™d like to report a bug you found in any of the components, request a feature to be implemented (or included if you already have a patch) or just to track the progress, direct your browser to:

The Qt applet repository is located at:

Please read the [Contribute](/usbguard/contribute) page if you want to contribute to the USBGuard project.
